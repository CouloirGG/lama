Summary,Issue Type,Epic Name,Epic Link,Description,Priority,Labels
Pricing Engine Accuracy,Epic,Pricing Engine Accuracy,,Improve the accuracy and intelligence of item pricing across all item types. Covers mod classification improvements; ilvl awareness; resistance valuation; calibration bootstrapping; and synergy detection.,High,pricing
Add per-slot ilvl breakpoint tables,Story,,Pricing Engine Accuracy,"Different equipment slots have different ilvl breakpoints for top-tier mods (e.g. bows need ilvl 82 for top phys% but wands only need 81). Build per-slot breakpoint tables and factor ilvl into loot filter tiering for exceptional bases. Data source: RePoE mod tiers.",Medium,pricing
Improve common mod classification heuristic,Story,,Pricing Engine Accuracy,"Current common mod classification is heuristic-based and may occasionally misclassify an unusual valuable mod as 'common'. Investigate data-driven approaches: use RePoE tier data to determine if a mod is valuable based on its tier rank rather than pattern matching. Consider using the mod_database weight table as the source of truth.",Medium,pricing
Handle Grants Skill edge cases,Story,,Pricing Engine Accuracy,"Unusual 'Grants Skill:' formats might not be stripped by _SKIP_LINE_RE in trade_client.py and could leak into trade queries. Audit all skill grant formats in the game data and expand the regex to cover edge cases.",Low,pricing
Add Resistance SOMV scoring,Story,,Pricing Engine Accuracy,"High resistance rolls add real value beyond what the trade query captures. If a resist mod is above 40% (fire/cold/lightning) or 20% (chaos) calculate a sum-of-mod-value bonus and factor it into the score. Could be a multiplier or flat addition to help differentiate e.g. a ring with 43% fire res from one with 20%.",Medium,pricing
Ship pre-built calibration data shard,Story,,Pricing Engine Accuracy,"Ship a curated calibration.jsonl with the repo so new users get reasonable price estimates from day one. Consider league-aware shards since calibration data from one league may not apply to another. Update periodically as more data is collected.",Medium,pricing
Add multi-mod synergy detection,Story,,Pricing Engine Accuracy,"Certain mod combinations are worth more together than the sum of their parts (e.g. %increased phys + flat phys on weapons or +life + all res on jewelry). Detect known synergy pairs and apply a score multiplier when both are present.",Medium,pricing
Add jewel and charm scoring support,Story,,Pricing Engine Accuracy,"Jewels and charms have different valuable mod pools than equipment. Extend mod_database weight tables to cover jewel-specific mods (e.g. crit multi; life; damage) and charm-specific mods (duration; effect). Currently these item classes may get inaccurate grades.",Medium,pricing
Add influence and fractured mod value recognition,Story,,Pricing Engine Accuracy,"Fractured mods lock a guaranteed roll which significantly increases item value. Influence mods (if POE2 adds them) similarly add value. Score_item should apply a bonus multiplier when fractured mods are present especially for T1-T2 fractured rolls.",Medium,pricing
Overlay Visual Polish,Epic,Overlay Visual Polish,,Make the price overlay more visually appealing and informative. Covers currency icons; game-native styling; celebration effects; and improved dismiss/scrap indicators.,Medium,overlay
Show currency icons next to price text,Story,,Overlay Visual Polish,"Display small currency images (Divine; Exalted; Chaos orb icons) next to the price text in the overlay instead of just the currency name string.

Add scrap indicator for quality/socketed dismissed items,Story,,Overlay Visual Polish,"Items dismissed as ✗ that have quality% or sockets should show a scrap/hammer icon instead reminding players to break them down for etchers; armour scraps; whetstones; baubles; gemcutters. These crafting materials are valuable for upgrades and currency exchange.",Low,overlay
Implement game-native visual style,Story,,Overlay Visual Polish,"Make the price overlay look like part of the POE2 game UI — matching fonts (FontinSmallCaps or similar); dark translucent panel styling; gold/brown borders similar to tooltip frames. Even though it's a separate overlay it should feel integrated.",Medium,overlay
Add high-value visual celebration,Story,,Overlay Visual Polish,"Stronger visual feedback when something is high value. Ideas: particle/glow effects around the price tag; brief screen-edge flash; optional sound alert (cha-ching). Should be toggleable. The rainbow mirror-tier effect already exists — extend for other thresholds.",Low,overlay
Add compact vs expanded overlay mode,Story,,Overlay Visual Polish,"Toggle between a compact mode (just price + grade) and an expanded mode (price + grade + top mods + tier breakdown + DPS/defense). Compact is default for speed; expanded for learning. Could be triggered by holding Shift while hovering.",Medium,overlay
Show mod tier labels in expanded overlay,Story,,Overlay Visual Polish,"In expanded overlay mode show T1/T2/T3 labels next to each mod line. Uses the existing mod_database tier ladder data. Helps players learn which mods are the valuable ones driving the grade.",Medium,overlay

Create Windows installer,Story,,Desktop Application,"Build a proper installer using NSIS; Inno Setup; or PyInstaller+NSIS. Should handle Python bundling (or detect existing Python); create Start Menu shortcut; optionally add to startup; set up file associations. Removes the 'install Python and Git' barrier for new users.",Medium,app
Add auto-updater,Story,,Desktop Application,"Check GitHub releases on startup for new versions. Show a notification if an update is available with a one-click update button. Could use GitHub API to compare version tags. Should handle the update gracefully (download; extract; restart).",Low,app

Mock the HTTP layer.",Medium,testing
Add end-to-end pipeline integration tests,Story,,Testing and Quality,"Full pipeline tests: clipboard text → parse → score → price lookup → overlay display text. Use archived clipboard captures as input and validate the complete output chain. Should catch regressions in the interaction between components.",Medium,testing

Add real-time filter reload notification,Story,,Loot Filter Intelligence,"After updating the filter file notify the user to reload in-game. If possible detect when the game has reloaded the filter (file access timestamp) and confirm. Show a brief overlay notification: 'Filter updated — reload in game'.",Low,filter
