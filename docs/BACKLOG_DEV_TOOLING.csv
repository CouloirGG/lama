Multi-Claude Launcher,Epic,Multi-Claude Launcher,,"A desktop application that manages multiple Claude Code CLI instances working on the same project in a single UI. Phase 1 is a purpose-built terminal multiplexer with labeled panes and a global rate limit dashboard. Phase 2 adds shared awareness via a coordination file that all instances read/write. Phase 3 adds an orchestrator that assigns work and resolves conflicts.",High,launcher
Build the launcher shell with multi-pane terminal UI,Story,,Multi-Claude Launcher,"Create the base application (Electron + xterm.js or Python + PyQt terminal widgets) that can spawn multiple Claude Code CLI processes in separate panes within one window. Core features: add/remove panes; label each pane by task/role (e.g. 'Pricing Engine'; 'Test Writer'); resize panes; keyboard shortcuts to switch focus between panes. Each pane runs an independent 'claude' process in the same working directory.",High,launcher
Add instance lifecycle management,Story,,Multi-Claude Launcher,"Spawn; pause; resume; and kill Claude instances from the launcher UI. Show instance status (running; idle; waiting for input; errored). Auto-restart crashed instances with their last context. Track resource usage (memory; CPU) per instance to avoid overloading the machine.",High,launcher
Add session save and restore,Story,,Multi-Claude Launcher,"Save the current launcher layout (number of panes; labels; positions; working directory) as a named session profile. Restore sessions on next launch. Useful for recurring workflows like 'POE2 dev' (3 instances) or 'methodology writing' (2 instances).",Medium,launcher
Add instance kickoff templates,Story,,Multi-Claude Launcher,"Pre-configured starting prompts for each instance. When spawning a new pane the user can select a template: 'Feature Developer' (reads HANDOFF.md and works on backlog items); 'Test Writer' (reads code and writes tests); 'Reviewer' (reviews recent changes); 'Researcher' (explores codebase and documents findings). Templates inject an initial prompt into the Claude session.",Medium,launcher
Add visual activity indicators per pane,Story,,Multi-Claude Launcher,"Show at-a-glance status for each pane without reading the full output: a colored dot (green=active; yellow=waiting for approval; red=error; grey=idle); last action summary ('Edited overlay.py 30s ago'); file change count since launch. Helps the user know which instance needs attention.",Medium,launcher
Add cross-instance notification system,Story,,Multi-Claude Launcher,"When one instance completes a significant action (finishes a task; encounters an error; needs user input) show a notification badge on its pane tab and optionally a desktop notification. Prevents the user from missing important events in a pane they're not watching.",Medium,launcher
Add global rate limit dashboard bar,Story,,Multi-Claude Launcher,"A persistent status bar pinned to the top of the launcher window showing real-time API usage across all instances. Display: requests used / limit (RPM); input tokens used / limit (ITPM); output tokens used / limit (OTPM); time until current window resets. Use color-coded progress bars: green (<50%); yellow (50-80%); red (>80%). Update every few seconds. This is the single most important piece of information for a user running multiple instances — it must be always visible and impossible to miss.",High,launcher;rate-limits
Add per-instance token consumption tracking,Story,,Multi-Claude Launcher,"Track and display token usage per instance in real time. Show a small usage indicator on each pane's tab: tokens consumed this session; requests made; estimated cost. Helps the user identify which instance is burning the most budget and whether to pause it. The per-instance numbers should sum to match the global dashboard.",High,launcher;rate-limits
Add rate limit auto-throttling,Story,,Multi-Claude Launcher,"When the global rate limit dashboard hits 80% usage in any window automatically pause the lowest-priority instance(s) to prevent all instances from getting throttled simultaneously. Resume paused instances when usage drops below 50%. Priority is set by the user per-pane (or defaults to most-recently-spawned = lowest priority). Show a clear 'Auto-paused: rate limit' indicator on affected panes.",High,launcher;rate-limits
Add spawn warning when near rate limits,Story,,Multi-Claude Launcher,"When the user tries to spawn a new instance and current usage is already above 60% show a warning: 'You are using 73% of your rate limit with 2 active instances. Adding a third will likely cause throttling. Proceed anyway?' Include a quick summary of the math: current RPM usage; projected RPM with N+1 instances; time until the next rate window resets.",Medium,launcher;rate-limits
Add plan-aware budget calculator,Story,,Multi-Claude Launcher,"Detect or let the user configure which Anthropic plan they are on (Pro; Max 5x; Max 20x; API Tier 1-4). Show plan-specific limits in the dashboard. Calculate and display: estimated active hours remaining this session/day/week; recommended max concurrent instances for this plan. E.g. 'Max 5x: ~3 instances sustainable; you have ~6 hours of budget remaining today'.",Medium,launcher;rate-limits
Add rate limit history and trends view,Story,,Multi-Claude Launcher,"Track rate limit usage over time within and across sessions. Show a simple chart: usage % over the last hour; daily usage trend; peak usage times. Helps users understand their consumption patterns and plan sessions accordingly. Store in a local metrics database.",Low,launcher;rate-limits
Add plan upgrade guidance and cost comparison,Story,,Multi-Claude Launcher,"When users consistently hit rate limits show a helpful (non-pushy) suggestion: 'You hit rate limits 12 times this week. Upgrading from Max 5x ($100/mo) to Max 20x ($200/mo) would give you 4x the budget.' Include a comparison table of all plans with their limits; link to Anthropic's pricing page; and a cost-per-hour-of-active-use estimate based on the user's actual usage patterns.",Low,launcher;rate-limits
Add API tier upgrade walkthrough,Story,,Multi-Claude Launcher,"For users on the API (not Pro/Max) include a step-by-step guide to requesting a tier upgrade from Anthropic: where to go (console.anthropic.com); what information to provide (use case; expected volume); typical approval timelines; what each tier unlocks. Pull the current tier limits dynamically from Anthropic's docs or API if possible so the info stays up to date.",Low,launcher;rate-limits
Shared State Coordination,Epic,Shared State Coordination,,"Enable multiple Claude Code instances to coordinate via a shared text file that acts as a lightweight message board. Each instance reads the file before starting work and updates it after completing tasks. Covers the file protocol; CLAUDE.md instructions; conflict avoidance; and loop prevention.",High,coordination
Design the shared state file protocol,Story,,Shared State Coordination,"Define the format and conventions for the shared coordination file (e.g. WORKSPACE_STATE.md). Sections: ACTIVE TASKS (who is working on what); COMPLETED (recently finished work with summary); AVAILABLE (unclaimed tasks); FILE LOCKS (files currently being edited and by whom); MESSAGES (free-form notes between instances). Each entry has a timestamp and instance ID. Keep it under 200 lines so Claude instances can read it quickly.",High,coordination
Write CLAUDE.md coordination instructions,Story,,Shared State Coordination,"Add instructions to CLAUDE.md that tell all Claude instances how to use the shared state file. Rules: 1) Read WORKSPACE_STATE.md before starting any task; 2) Claim your task by adding it to ACTIVE TASKS with your instance label; 3) Do not edit files listed in FILE LOCKS by another instance; 4) When done move your task to COMPLETED with a one-line summary; 5) Check for MESSAGES directed at you. These instructions make coordination automatic for any Claude instance launched in the project.",High,coordination
Build the shared state file initializer,Story,,Shared State Coordination,"A script or launcher feature that creates/resets the WORKSPACE_STATE.md with the correct template structure. Include initial AVAILABLE tasks pulled from the project backlog or TODO.md. The launcher runs this on session start so all instances start with a clean slate.",Medium,coordination
Implement task claiming and conflict avoidance,Story,,Shared State Coordination,"Define the protocol for claiming tasks and avoiding conflicts: an instance writes 'CLAIMED: [task] — [instance-label] — [timestamp]' to the ACTIVE section. If two instances claim the same task (race condition) the earlier timestamp wins and the later instance must pick something else. For file-level conflicts: an instance declares 'EDITING: [filepath] — [instance-label]' before modifying a file. Other instances must not edit that file until the lock is released.",High,coordination
Add loop detection and prevention rules,Story,,Shared State Coordination,"Define anti-loop conventions in the CLAUDE.md instructions: 1) Never undo work another instance just completed (check COMPLETED before reverting); 2) If you see your own previous work in COMPLETED do not redo it; 3) If you and another instance are editing the same area stop and leave a MESSAGE asking the user to arbitrate; 4) Maximum 2 consecutive updates to the shared state file without doing actual work (prevents state-file ping-pong).",High,coordination
Build a shared state file watcher/validator,Story,,Shared State Coordination,"A lightweight background process (part of the launcher) that monitors WORKSPACE_STATE.md for issues: duplicate claims on the same task; stale locks (instance died without releasing); file growing too large; format corruption. Alerts the user and optionally auto-fixes (remove stale locks; archive old COMPLETED entries).",Medium,coordination
Add a coordination activity dashboard,Story,,Shared State Coordination,"A panel in the launcher UI that visualizes the shared state: which instance is working on what; which files are locked; recent completions timeline; any conflicts or warnings. Reads WORKSPACE_STATE.md and presents it as a clean dashboard instead of raw markdown.",Medium,launcher;coordination
Implement graduated awareness levels,Story,,Shared State Coordination,"Not all instances need full awareness of everything. Define levels: Level 0 (independent — no shared state); Level 1 (file locks only — just avoid editing conflicts); Level 2 (task awareness — know what others are working on); Level 3 (full coordination — read summaries of others' work and adapt). User selects level per instance. Lower levels have less overhead and fewer loop risks.",Medium,coordination
Claude Code Project Templates,Epic,Claude Code Project Templates,,"Pre-built project starter kits that set up CLAUDE.md; MEMORY.md; hooks; directory structure; and conventions for effective AI-augmented development. Lowers the barrier to using Claude Code well on any project.",Medium,templates
Build the standard project template,Story,,Claude Code Project Templates,"A base template that any project can use: CLAUDE.md with sensible defaults (coding conventions; file organization; testing expectations); .claude/ directory with memory structure; a HANDOFF.md template; recommended .gitignore additions for Claude artifacts. Installable via a CLI command or cookiecutter.",Medium,templates
Build the multi-agent project template,Story,,Claude Code Project Templates,"An extended template specifically for projects using multiple Claude instances: includes WORKSPACE_STATE.md; CLAUDE.md with coordination instructions; hook configurations for auto-updating shared state; instance role templates. Everything needed to launch a multi-Claude session from scratch.",Medium,templates
Build the rapid prototype template,Story,,Claude Code Project Templates,"A template optimized for the fast prototyping methodology: minimal CLAUDE.md focused on shipping fast; TODO.md with session-based tracking; lightweight test structure; no over-engineering guardrails built into the instructions. Matches the approach used for the POE2 overlay.",Medium,templates
Build the enterprise project template,Story,,Claude Code Project Templates,"A template for larger/corporate projects: comprehensive CLAUDE.md with strict coding standards; mandatory test coverage; PR review requirements; documentation expectations; security guardrails. More guardrails than the prototype template.",Low,templates
Claude Code Hooks and Automation,Epic,Claude Code Hooks and Automation,,"Build useful hook configurations and automation scripts that enhance Claude Code workflows. Hooks run shell commands in response to Claude Code events (file edits; bash commands; etc.) and can enforce conventions; collect metrics; or trigger coordination updates.",Medium,hooks
Build a shared state auto-updater hook,Story,,Claude Code Hooks and Automation,"A Claude Code hook that fires after every file edit and automatically updates WORKSPACE_STATE.md with: which file was just edited; by which instance; at what time. Removes the need for Claude to manually update the shared state — it happens automatically. Must handle concurrent writes safely (append with file locking).",High,hooks;coordination
Build a file conflict prevention hook,Story,,Claude Code Hooks and Automation,"A pre-edit hook that checks WORKSPACE_STATE.md before allowing a file edit. If another instance has the file locked the hook blocks the edit and returns a message telling Claude to work on something else. Prevents the most common coordination failure mode.",High,hooks;coordination
Build a git auto-commit hook,Story,,Claude Code Hooks and Automation,"A hook that auto-commits changes after each significant edit (or batch of edits) with a descriptive message. Keeps a granular git history that serves as an activity log. Useful for multi-instance setups where you want to see exactly what each instance did. Commits to instance-specific branches to avoid conflicts.",Medium,hooks
Build a session metrics collection hook,Story,,Claude Code Hooks and Automation,"A hook that logs metrics after every tool call: tool type; file affected; timestamp; instance label; duration. Writes to a session_metrics.jsonl file. Enables post-session analysis: which instance was most productive; which files were edited most; where time was spent.",Low,hooks
Build a code quality gate hook,Story,,Claude Code Hooks and Automation,"A post-edit hook that runs lightweight quality checks after every file edit: syntax validation; import sorting; basic lint rules. If checks fail the hook returns feedback to Claude so it can fix the issue immediately. Catches problems before they compound.",Medium,hooks
AI Development Workflow Recipes,Epic,AI Development Workflow Recipes,,"Pre-built workflow patterns for common multi-Claude development scenarios. Each recipe includes: instance count and roles; CLAUDE.md instructions; coordination approach; and expected workflow. Ready to load into the launcher as session templates.",Medium,recipes
Build the Feature + Test parallel recipe,Story,,AI Development Workflow Recipes,"Two-instance recipe: Instance A implements features; Instance B writes tests for the code Instance A produces. Coordination: A updates shared state when a function/module is complete; B reads it and writes tests. B can also flag issues it finds back to A via the shared state file.",High,recipes
Build the Build + Review recipe,Story,,AI Development Workflow Recipes,"Two-instance recipe: Instance A writes code; Instance B reviews it. B periodically reads recent file changes (via git diff or shared state) and writes review comments to a REVIEW.md file. A reads review feedback and addresses it. Simulates a continuous code review loop.",Medium,recipes
Build the Parallel Feature recipe,Story,,AI Development Workflow Recipes,"Three-instance recipe: Each instance works on a different feature/epic simultaneously. Coordination is primarily file-lock-based — they stay out of each other's files. A merge coordinator (script or fourth instance) integrates their branches periodically. Good for large backlogs with independent work streams.",Medium,recipes
Build the Research + Implement recipe,Story,,AI Development Workflow Recipes,"Two-instance recipe: Instance A explores the codebase and writes findings to a research doc (RESEARCH.md). Instance B reads the research and implements based on the findings. Useful when the task requires deep codebase understanding before coding (e.g. refactoring; debugging complex issues).",Medium,recipes
Build the Swarm recipe,Story,,AI Development Workflow Recipes,"Four+ instance recipe for maximum throughput on a large backlog. Each instance picks the next available task from a shared task list in WORKSPACE_STATE.md; claims it; completes it; marks it done; picks the next one. Minimal coordination beyond task claiming and file locks. High throughput but higher conflict risk — best for independent tasks.",Low,recipes
Orchestrator Agent,Epic,Orchestrator Agent,,"A meta-agent that manages and coordinates multiple Claude Code instances. Instead of instances self-coordinating via a shared file the orchestrator assigns work; monitors progress; resolves conflicts; and synthesizes results. This is the most advanced coordination mode.",Low,orchestrator
Design the orchestrator architecture,Story,,Orchestrator Agent,"Define how the orchestrator works: a separate process (not a Claude instance) that reads the project backlog; decomposes it into parallelizable tasks; assigns tasks to Claude instances via their shared state files or stdin injection; monitors progress by watching file changes and shared state; and intervenes when conflicts arise. Document the architecture and communication protocol.",Medium,orchestrator
Build the task decomposition engine,Story,,Orchestrator Agent,"Given a high-level task (e.g. 'implement the stash management epic') the orchestrator breaks it into parallelizable sub-tasks; identifies dependencies; and creates an execution plan. Uses file dependency analysis (which tasks touch which files) to maximize parallelism while minimizing conflicts.",Medium,orchestrator
Build the progress monitor,Story,,Orchestrator Agent,"The orchestrator watches: git commits; file modification timestamps; shared state updates; and instance stdout for signs of progress or problems. Detects: stalled instances (no activity for N minutes); conflicting edits; instances going off-task; rate limit exhaustion. Reports status to the user via the launcher dashboard.",Medium,orchestrator
Build the conflict resolver,Story,,Orchestrator Agent,"When two instances create conflicting changes the orchestrator: pauses both instances; analyzes the conflict (git merge conflict or logical conflict); either auto-resolves (if one change is clearly better) or escalates to the user with a clear summary of what happened and options for resolution.",Low,orchestrator
Build the result synthesizer,Story,,Orchestrator Agent,"After all instances complete their tasks the orchestrator creates a summary: what was accomplished; which files were changed; any issues encountered; suggested follow-up tasks. Writes to a SESSION_SUMMARY.md. Useful for the user to review what happened across all instances.",Low,orchestrator
Developer Tooling Distribution,Epic,Developer Tooling Distribution,,"Package and distribute the multi-Claude launcher; templates; hooks; and recipes as installable tools. Make it easy for other developers to adopt the multi-agent workflow.",Low,distribution
Package the launcher as a standalone app,Story,,Developer Tooling Distribution,"Build distributable packages for the launcher: Windows installer (MSI/NSIS); macOS .dmg; Linux AppImage. Should detect Claude Code installation and configure itself. Include bundled templates; hooks; and recipes.",Medium,distribution
Publish hooks and templates as a Claude Code extension,Story,,Developer Tooling Distribution,"Package the hooks; CLAUDE.md templates; and coordination files as a distributable extension. Could be a GitHub repo that users clone into their .claude/ directory or a CLI tool that installs them: 'claude-multi init'.",Medium,distribution
Create documentation and getting started guide,Story,,Developer Tooling Distribution,"Comprehensive docs: installation; first multi-instance session walkthrough; recipe selection guide; troubleshooting common issues (loops; conflicts; stale locks). Include video/GIF demos of the launcher in action.",Medium,distribution
Set up a community recipe repository,Story,,Developer Tooling Distribution,"A public GitHub repo where users share their own workflow recipes; hook configurations; and project templates. Curated submissions with quality standards. The launcher can browse and install community recipes directly.",Low,distribution
