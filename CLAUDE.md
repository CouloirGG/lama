# LAMA (Live Auction Market Assessor) — Project Instructions

## Git Workflow
- **Always work on the `dev` branch.** All commits go to `dev`.
- Never commit directly to `main`. `main` is the stable release branch for players.
- When ready to release, merge `dev → main` via PR and tag with a version.
- **Never add `Co-Authored-By` trailers to commits.** No AI attribution in commit messages.
